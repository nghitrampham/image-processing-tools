To start the GUI: 
1. Navigate to the terminal and go to the path contain the file
2. Run the command python3 mainGUI.py to start the GUI.


The aim of this project is to demonstrate how image processing techniques are 
utilized to solve image processing problems and perform a real-time 
demonstration of an image processing example via a simple graphic user interface (GUI).
This demo is built based on my knowledge learned from class and external research. 
In this project, I will implement several of the image processing techniques, 
including Specification Histogram Equalization, Image Pyramid (downsize), Gaussian 
Blurring, Low Pass Filtering, and Edge Detection. Besides, I also implemented
 the water coloring effect to produce image that looks like a water painting.
 I intend to use the GUI to analyze the image, see how each parameter affects
 the result, and produce artist effect without arty work. Users can load an 
image and perform real-time processing with a small overhead to produce a better
 image or enhance its quality.
